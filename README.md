# Self-Assessment

In week 1 of our project, I took on the square role, setting up the GitHub repository with branches for each team member, getting us ready to work collaboratively.  I helped to source much of our data used by our circle team member to put together the PostGres database.  This data mining also helped our triangle member start working on the ML part of the project.  I also got a jump working on data visualization by taking the lead on our Tableau dashboard.  Finally, I actively participated in the selection of technologies, marshalled by our X member.

In week 2, I filled the X role, working on the dashboard, but also contributing greatly to the circle role, sourcing and analyzing data.  The data I sourced and cleaned helped make the jobs of the square and triangle easier.

In week 3, I was in the circle role, developing and refining our dashboard.  I also assisted in drafting the presentation for the class.

In week 4, I was in the triangle role, finalizing and polishing our presentation and Tableau dashboard.  I thought the finished product was amazing!

Coming from a sales and marketing background, pulling off a memorable presentation sets you apart from the competition.  I really enjoyed the week we spent on Tableau during the class, and reveled in the opportunity to expand and hone my new-found skills during the final project.  There were certain persuasive effects I admired in the Tableau presentations of others, but figuring out how to achieve these visualizations was not always clear.  Through research and trial and error, I was able to include many of the techniques that caught my attention in these other presentations.  I am proud and confident that I put together an impactful, eye-catching, and interactive dashboard.

I was happy and proud of the teamwork that Cristina, Samira, Drew and I exhibited.  We all contributed to the success of our project, did not let our egos get in the way, and give and took in molding the final product.  We got together frequently outside of class in team Zoom calls and exchanged information often via Slack.  I couldn't have hoped for a more cohesive team.

The COVID-19/Coronavirus pandemic has rocked the world, our country, and our state of California during the last several months.  We wanted to examine and evaluate the data, at both a state and county level, to determine how the pandemic has impacted us so far, and what it might portend for the coming month.  We utilized time series machine learning - both ARIMA and Vector Autoregression (VAR) to predict the progression of COVID infections over the coming month.  The ARIMA model was more accurate in predicting impending infections, but it would have been nice to have more time and add more features to the models to increase accuracy and also to drill down to the more local, county level.

The last 6 months has been a lot of work, but it has been very rewarding and I've learned a great deal.  Thank you for the opportunity to a part of
